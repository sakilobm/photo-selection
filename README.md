## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   **PHP 8.1+** (CLI enabled)
*   **MySQL 8.0+**
*   **Apache** (with `mod_rewrite` enabled)
*   **Composer**

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sakilobm/Aether-Catalyst.git
    cd Aether-Catalyst
    ```

2.  Ensure the `skeleton/` directory is present (contains the core framework files).

## 🏗️ Generating a New Project

The `forge.php` script is your primary tool for scaffolding. It handles directory creation, configuration, and database initialization. You can now create projects in **any directory** on your system.

```bash
# Interactive Mode
php forge.php

# Quick Setup
php forge.php "Nebula CMS" ./my-projects/nebula
```

### What happens during Forge?

1.  **Identity:** Define your project title (e.g., "Nebula CMS").
2.  **Location:** Choose where to create the project (Default: `projects/{slug}`).
3.  **Database:** Input your MySQL credentials. Forge creates the DB and runs `base.sql`.
4.  **Paths:** Set your `base_path` (e.g., `/nebula/htdocs/`).
5.  **Scaffolding:** Copies the clean skeleton into your target directory.
6.  **Intelligence:** Generates `AI_PROMPT.md` inside your new project folder.

## 🛠️ Catalyst CLI Commands

Forge isn't just for setup; it also helps you build your application:

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `php forge.php` | Start interactive project setup |
| `php forge.php [title] [path]` | Quick project creation with custom title and location |
| `php forge.php make:controller [name]` | Generate a new closure-based API endpoint |
| `php forge.php make:model [name]` | Generate a new ORM class with `SQLGetterSetter` |
| `php forge.php make:env` | Regenerate `.env` and `config.json` for an existing project |

## 🧠 AI-Driven Development Workflow

Every generated project includes an `AI_PROMPT.md`. This file is designed to be pasted into **ChatGPT (o1/o3)**, **Claude 3.7+**, or **Antigravity**.

It provides the AI with:
-   Full class signatures and available methods.
-   The exact closure-based API pattern.
-   Template injection rules.
-   Security standards for the project.

**Use this prompt to build features in seconds:** 
> "Generate a 'Product' model and an admin interface to manage inventory based on the framework rules in this prompt."

## 📜 Core Coding Rules

1.  **Bootstrap First:** All PHP files must start with `require_once 'libs/load.php';`.
2.  **No Hardcoding:** Use `get_config('key')` for all credentials and paths.
3.  **Sanitize Always:** The `REST` base class handles input cleaning; use `$this->_request`.
4.  **Secure Writes:** Call `$this->isAuthenticated()` in all write-level API endpoints.
5.  **Template Engine:** Use `Session::loadTemplate('folder/file', $data)` for all UI components.

---

> [!TIP]
> Always run `composer install` inside the `htdocs` directory of your generated project to pull in dependencies like Carbon and RabbitMQ.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `config.json` file is automatically added to `.gitignore`. Never commit your production credentials!
